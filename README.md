# Hey, I'm Bishnu Bista

**Full-Stack Engineer | AI Agent Builder | Community Organizer**

Building AI agents, contributing to open source, and helping developers harness the power of agentic coding. Most of my work is built with Claude Code and Codex, where I'm discovering patterns for agentic development — multi-agent orchestration, custom workflow agents, and knowledge systems that compound across projects. When I'm not coding, you'll find me running marathons or training for triathlons.

## What I Build

**AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems**
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph, human-in-the-loop approval gates, and multi-LLM consensus (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Voice AI pipelines using Pipecat and Deepgram for real-time speech processing with structured output via function calling
- Vision AI document extraction with multi-provider support, hybrid OCR pipelines, and confidence-scored structured data
- Content generation agents with sequential pipelines where each approved output becomes context for the next

**MCP Security & Tooling**
- Collaborator on [SAFE-MCP](https://github.com/SAFE-MCP/safe-mcp) — security framework documenting 80+ attack techniques for Model Context Protocol
- Built MCP security scanners using hybrid regex + LLM analysis with SARIF output
- Created developer tools for AI-assisted debugging, session logging, and workflow orchestration

**Full-Stack Development**
- Production apps with Next.js 15+, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, and Vercel
- Python backends with FastAPI, Clean Architecture, and uv package manager
- iOS/watchOS apps with SwiftUI, SwiftData, and HealthKit — shipped to App Store

## Hackathons & Demos

- Built a **voice AI medical assistant** that passively listens to doctor-patient conversations and generates structured clinical notes in real-time (Gemini + Pipecat + Deepgram)
- Created an **emotion-adaptive AI interviewer** that analyzes both speech content and vocal patterns for real-time sentiment detection (OpenAI Whisper + ElevenLabs)
- Built a **repository-to-podcast generator** that turns any GitHub repo into a 3-5 minute podcast with real code citations (Greptile + ElevenLabs)
- Developed an **autonomous GTM agent** with real-time event streaming, AI lead scoring, and self-improving outreach (Redpanda + OpenAI)
